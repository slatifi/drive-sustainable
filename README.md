# DRIVE-Health Sustainable Software Engineering Workshop

This workshop concentrates on the **longevity** and **utility** of your research code. We will explore techniques to ensure your research artefacts are accessible to peers and built to last, rather than just sitting in a notebook! The curriculum is designed specifically to support _scientific reproducibility_, rather than teaching web or mobile development.
