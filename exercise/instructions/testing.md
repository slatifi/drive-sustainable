# Testing Exercise

For the rest of this workshop, we will be building upon a simple service - the `Basket` service. This service allows users to create a basket, add items to it, and calculate the total price of the items in the basket.

Within this exercise, you will implement tests for the `Basket` service to ensure its functionality is correct and reliable, correcting any issues you find along the way.

The two files of interest are:

- `exercise/basket.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `Basket` service.
- `exercise/test_basket.py`: This file contains the test cases for the `Basket` service. There are 2 basic tests already implemented, but you will need to add more tests to cover all functionalities of the `Basket` service.

Remember, tests should not only cover expected behaviour but also **edge cases and potential error scenarios**. Good luck!
