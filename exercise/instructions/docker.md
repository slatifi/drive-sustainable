# Docker exercise

This exercise requires Docker to be installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker installed, you can use the workflow called `build` to run the exercise in a GitHub Actions environment.

This goal of the exercise is to Dockerise your **Flask API**.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile` in `exercise/` directory.
2. In the `Dockerfile`, write the necessary instructions to run the server.

> [!TIP]
> Hint: You can start from the following base image: `python:3.10-slim`.
